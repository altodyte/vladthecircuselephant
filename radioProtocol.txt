Mega sends 28-byte data packets every 10 ms to RX over serial
when RX sees data packet in its serial buffer, switch to transmit and send it to TX over radio
after data packet is sent, switch to listening to wait for response
if response is received, do stuff with it

when TX sees data packet over radio, forward it out over serial and switch to transmit (wait 1ms)
transmit 5-byte command packet if one came in over serial, otherwise just send ack back to RX
once transmit is done, switch back to listening for next data packet
